Run the following command from where you need to create the directory structure (in my scenario from a directory
called clients which is the directory above `client_dir_structure`):

```
$ cookiecutter client_dir_structure
```

Enter inputs and Voila!

See https://github.com/topics/cookiecutter-template for inspiration.
